    <h1>Bruschetta with tomato and basil</h1>
    <img src="img/bruschetta.jpg" alt="Lasagna">

       <h3>Ingredients:</h3>


       <ul>
        <li>6 to 7 ripe tomatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>6 to 8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced or chopped</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste</li>
        <li>1 baguette, French bread, or similar Italian bread</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        </ul>
       <ol>


        <li><h3>Blanch and peel the tomatoes</h3></li>
        <p>Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern</p>
        <p>at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).</p>
        <p>Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put scored tomatoes in the</p> 
            <p>hot water and blanch for 1 minute.</p>
            <p>Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato</p>
            <p>skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife. Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.</p>
        <li><h3>Let this simmer while you boil the lasagne and get the cheeses ready. </h3></li>
        <p>We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and 
            parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</p>
        <li><h3>Preheat oven.</h3></li>
        <p>to 450째F (230째C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.</p>
        <li><h3>Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper</h3></li>
        <p>Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.</p>
        <p>Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste.</p>
        <li><h3>Toast the baguette slices</h3></li>
        <p>Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here)</p>
        <p>and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan. The baguette slices will</p>
        <p>toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all</p>
        <p>When the oven has reached 450째F (230째C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.</p>
        <li><h3>Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture</h3></li>
        <p>Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier</p>
        <p>keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).</p>
        <p>use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.</p>
        </ol>
