        <li>1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil. </li>
        <li>70 g (3/4 cup) of Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        <li>30 g (2 tablespoons) of Pecorino Fiore Sardo</li>
        <li>2 peeled garlic cloves/li>
        <li>15 g (1 tablespoon) of pine nuts</li>

       </ul>

        <li><h3>First step</h3></li>
        <p>How to make pesto greener? Here is a trick! Take the blades and the bowl of the food
             processor. Put them into the refrigerator for about 10 minutes <p>until the tools 
             *are very cold. Meantime, prepare basil leaves washing them with cold water.</p> 
             Finally, place them in a large bowl with plenty of ice for 3-4 minutes.</p>
        <li><h3>Second Step </h3></li>
        <p>Now dry the leaves very well on a kitchen towel (important: the basil leaves must be very dry). 
            Place them into the food processor <p>(that now is pretty cold) with garlic, 
            pine nuts and grated Parmigiano.</p>
            If you will follow these tips you’ll have a very green pesto sauce.</p>
        <li><h3>Third Step</h3></li>
        <p>Chop the ingredients coarsely for a few seconds. Then add salt and Pecorino Fiore Sardo cheese 
            cut into small pieces. Blend all the ingredients for about 1 minute.<p>
            Now add extra virgin olive oil. Blend for about 5 minutes, until you’ll get a creamy green 
            pesto sauce.</p>
            Pesto must not heat up, so be careful to work quickly.  Use the food processor at minimum
            speed and at intervals, that is, blend a few seconds, stop and start again..</p>
        <li><h3>Fourth Step</h3></li>
        <p>Before seasoning your pasta dish, if the pesto is too thick, add 1 or 
            2 tablespoons of the cooking water.</p><p>This way you’ll have a warm homogeneous soft pesto sauce.
            You can even taste Genovese pesto spread on toasted bread, as an appetizer. Delicious!</p>
